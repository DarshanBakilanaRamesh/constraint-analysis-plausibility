## **Master's Thesis: "Extraction and Analysis of Dataset Constraints for Plausibility of Data."**

This repository contains the implementation, datasets, experiments, and documentation for my master's thesis at Bauhaus-UniversitÃ¤t Weimar. The thesis investigates techniques for **extracting dataset constraints** through Machine Learning model like **Isolation Forest** and compares them to manually defined constraints (**Handwritten**) in terms of **plausibility** and consistency.

## **Thesis Abstract**

This thesis focuses on extracting and defining dataset constraints through both **handwritten rules** and **machine-learned approaches** such as **Isolation Forest** and **SMT encoding**. The work aims to evaluate the quality and plausibility of constraints generated by automated methods in comparison to those defined by humans.

Key objectives include:

* Defining domain constraints manually and learning them using AI techniques

* Evaluating and comparing constraint accuracy, consistency, and usefulness

* Developing methods to **generate plausible datasets** that fully adhere to the identified constraints using formal reasoning via SMT solvers

The combination of machine learning and formal methods creates a framework for improving data quality, handling noisy or inconsistent entries, and enhancing model interpretability. This approach provides valuable insights into the integration of constraint learning in practical, AI-driven data workflows.
